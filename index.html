				<p> Ever wonder what it would be like to break away from the rat race? Could you sell your house, quit your job			, and put everything you own away in storage? Would you do it for a once in a lifetime chance to follow a dream to live on the road?</p>
<p> This is the story of people who did just that. Day after day, they went to work where they made money for soulless corporations. At the end of the day, their money went out as fast as it came in. Rent, mortgages, clothes to meet clients, buying more and more plastic junk from the stores.They realized that they were trapped in the American Nightmare and said enough was enough!</p>		
<p> From RVs to travel trailers to truck campers, these brave travelers hit the road found a way to make their dream of traveling across the country work. </p>
		<p>If you've ever wondered if you could do the same thing, then this is the movie for you.</p>
		<p>Permanent RVing is a lifestyle that appeals to retirees as well as young adults, couples and families with children, to single women. See how people from all walks of life make it work.</p>
		<h2>Finding community and kinship on the road</h2>
		<p>Once you are away from the constraints of society, the experiences you will have and the people you will meet will amaze you.</p>
		<p>You may be surprised that even when you are miles away from civilization, that you are never truly alone. The traveling community is always willing to lend a helping hand and support a fellow traveler in need.</p>

		<h2>Is it safe to travel on the road and camp alone?</h2>
		<p>While beginning travelers may stick to paid campsites and KOAs for safety, many seasoned RVers will boondock for the peace and quiet and to save money. Boondocking is camping off-grid without any hookup to city water, power, or sewer. While the East Coast and Midwest have limited opportunities to boondock, the West is wild and open. BLM (Bureau of Land Mangement) and National Forest lands are open to the public for camping and recreation. Most of these lands are found in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming, California, Oregon, and Washington. The only caveat is that you have to decamp and move your rig every 14 days or so.</p>
		<h2>What do you need to camp off-grid?</h2>
	<p>Before you tow your travel trailer out to the deserts of Nevada, you will have to prepare to survive or else you will prepare to die. You will need a source:
	<ul>
	<li>Water: Duh! The more the better. You need to figure out how much water your family uses per day to determine how many days you can stay off-grid. Your water use should include showering, washing the dishes, etc.</li>
	<li>Food: Many of these camping spots are hours away from the nearest towns or grocery stores. You will need to stock up before you head out.</li>
	<li>Electricity: You will need a source of electricity to run your refirgerator to keep your food fresh. As a boondocker, you will need to be your own power company. Electricity can be generated either with solar panels or a gas/diesel generator</li>
	<li>Gas: You will need to have enough gas on hand to get in and get out to the nearest gas station as well as have enough gas to run your generator.</li>
	<li>Propane: Most people will use propane for cooking, heating, and hot water. With a high powered and massive solar power system, it may be possible to cook and heat your RV with electricity. Such a system can be prohibitively expensive.</li>
	</ul>
