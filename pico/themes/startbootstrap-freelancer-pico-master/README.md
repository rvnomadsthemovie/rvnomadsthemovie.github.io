# [Start Bootstrap][] - [Freelancer][] - [Pico Version][PicoCMS]

This is a [PicoCMS][] port of for the [Freelancer][] portfolio theme based on [Bootstrap][], created by [Start Bootstrap][].

Live preview of [Freelancer][] available [here][Preview].

## Getting Started

To use this theme:

1. Download the [Latest Release][] on GitHub.
1. Extract `themes/freelancer` to your Pico `themes` folder.
1. Extract `index.md.sample` and `content/feed.md` (optional*) to your `content` folder.
1. Copy or rename `index.md.sample` to `index.md`
1. Configure your website using the YAML options in `index.md`

\* Provides an RSS feed of your pages at `/feed`

## Contact Form Setup

While out of the scope of this port, in order for the contact form to work, you'll need the php file [`mail/contact_me.php`][MailSupport] from the original HTML version of [Freelancer][].

You'll need to place the `mail` folder in the root of your Pico install.  From there, you'll need to edit `contact_me.php` to specify your email address.  There are additional options you can configure in this file as well.

Support for this feature will ultimately depend on the configuration of your server, but is again, out of scope of this port.

You can easily disable the contact form from within `index.md` if you do not wish to use it.
